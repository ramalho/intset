# The Go Programming Language

The https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/ repository provides the downloadable
example programs for the book, "The Go Programming Language"; see http://www.gopl.io.

Many of the programs contain comments of the form `//!+` and `//!-`.
These comments bracket the parts of the programs that are excerpted in the
book; you can safely ignore them. In a few cases, programsxhave been reformatted
in an unnatural way so that they can be presented in stages in the book.
